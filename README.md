# Testing Validity of my Ubuntu Rails Development System Setup  
  

## OVERVIEW  

This application is a test of my Ubuntu Rails Development Workstation setup.

Since I target the Heroku PostgreSQL-9.x 'Cedar' platform as my staging and production environments, I must configure my personal development workstation to successfully deploy my Ruby-on-Rails and related code to Heroku.

Although I have a long professional history of using Microsoft Windows operating for software development, I have abandoned all consideration of using Windows for my Ruby-on-Rails development. My reason? Windows has poor support for Ruby and the various tools that Ruby-on-Rails integrates under its control.

Between Apple's OS-X and Canonical Limited's Ubuntu, I prefer Ubuntu as my operating system for Ruby-on-Rails development. But that decision has not been without some pain since my initial Ubuntu workstation configuration attempts resulted in Ruby and Rails version upgrade difficulties. 

I was determined to improve my Ubuntu Ruby and Rails installs. My solution had to be the creation of a more consistent procedure for doing Ubuntu Development workstation installs. Towards that goal, I began to document software installation steps that worked best for me. Over time I was able to identify my errors and find better ways to install and support my desired software.

This application is a deployment test case for validating my best practice for my workstation installations especially with Heroku, PostgreSQL-9, Rails related software. This is a Work-In-Progress. I welcome suggestions for improving everything I do here.
