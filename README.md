# Application for Testing Validity of my Ubuntu Development System Setup 


## OVERVIEW

This application is a test of my Ubuntu Rails Development Workstation setup.

Since I target Heroku PostgreSQL-9.x 'Cedar' platform as my staging and production environments, I must configure my personal development workstation to be able to successfully deploy my Ruby-on-Rails and related code to that environment.

Although I have a long professional history of using Microsoft Windows operating for software development, I have abandon all consideration of using Windows for my Ruby-on-Rails development. This is mainly due to the poor support that Windows has for Ruby and the various tools that Ruby-on-Rails depends on for integrating different web development technologies under Rails' control.

Between Apple's OS-X and Canonical Limited's Ubuntu, I find that I prefer Ubuntu as my preferred development operating system for Ruby-on-Rails development. But that decision has not been without some pain since my initial attempts at configuring my development Ubuntu workstations were difficult to do version Ruby and Rails upgrades. 

I wanted to to better with my Ubuntu Ruby and Rails installs and find a way be be consistant with my Ubuntu Development workstation installs so I began to document on paper what software I installed and the steps I took to do the installs. Over time I was able to identify my errors and  find better ways to install Ruby and Rails, and supporting software.

This application is a deployed test for my choices that I have accepted as best practices for my installation procedure for creating and deploying a working Heroku, PostgreSQL-9, Rails application. This is a Work-In-Progress. I welcome suggestions for improving everything I do.
