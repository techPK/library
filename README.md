# Testing Validity of my Ubuntu Rails Development System Setup  
  

## OVERVIEW  

This application is a test of my Ubuntu Rails Development Workstation setup.

Since I target Heroku PostgreSQL-9.x 'Cedar' platform as my staging and production environments, I must configure my personal development workstation to be able to successfully deploy my Ruby-on-Rails and related code.

Although I have a long professional history of using Microsoft Windows operating for software development, I have abandon all consideration of using Windows for my Ruby-on-Rails development. This is mainly due to the poor support Windows has for Ruby and the various tools that Ruby-on-Rails depends on for integrating different web technologies under Rails' control.

Between Apple's OS-X and Canonical Limited's Ubuntu, I find that I prefer Ubuntu as my preferred operating system for Ruby-on-Rails development. But that decision has not been without some pain since my initial attempts at configuring my Ubuntu workstations resulted in difficulties with Ruby and Rails version upgrades. 

I wanted my Ubuntu Ruby and Rails installs to be better. I also wanted a more consistent procedure for doing Ubuntu Development workstation installs. As a result I began to document what software I installed and the installation steps that worked best for me. Over time I was able to identify my errors and find better ways to install and support my targeted Ruby and Rails and related software.

This application is a deployed test case for choices I accept as best practice for my workstation installations and for improving my procedures for creating and deploying a working Heroku, PostgreSQL-9, Rails application. This is a Work-In-Progress. I welcome suggestions for improving everything I do and especially for this.
